# About Me

Hello! My name is Felippe Rodrigo Puhle, I'm 31 years old and I live in São José do Cedro - Santa Catarina. I'm graduated in Internet Systems at UNISUL, and I'm a Software Engineer at HelloMD.

I love to develop software with clean code, and I'm fascinated with learning as many things as I can. I've been studying a lot to indulge this thirst for knowledge. Therefore, I love to pass on all the things that I've learned too.

I consider myself a communicative person, always doing my best to make things happen.
