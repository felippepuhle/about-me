# About Me

Hello! My name is **Felippe Rodrigo Puhle**, I'm 28 years old and I live in São Miguel do Oeste - Santa Catarina. I'm graduated in Internet Systems at UNISUL, and I'm a **full-stack developer** at [Entria](https://www.entria.com.br), currently working with bleeding edge technology - ReactJS, Relay and GraphQL.

I love to develop software with clean code, and I'm fictionalized to learn as many things that I can. I've been studying a lot to indulge this **thirst for knowledge**. Therefore, I love to pass on all the things that I've learned too.

I consider myself a communicative person, always doing my best to make things happen.
