# About Me

I'm a Software Engineer with industry experience building web and mobile apps using ReactJS, React Native, and GraphQL.

I love to develop software with clean code, and I'm fascinated with learning as many things as I can. I also love helping others to learn in the same way.

I consider myself a communicative person, always doing my best to make things happen.
